# AI-Assisted Vulnerability Discovery and Data Leakage Case Study  
### Platform: WhatsApp (Meta AI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents an **academic and security-focused case study**
analyzing potential vulnerabilities in AI-assisted messaging systems,
with specific reference to **Meta AI integration in WhatsApp**.

The project demonstrates how **prompt injection techniques** and
**context confusion** can lead to **partial data leakage**, even in the
absence of direct exploit code.

⚠️ This repository contains **no exploit scripts or malware**.
All demonstrations are **documentation-based and ethical**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand AI security vulnerabilities such as:
  - Prompt Injection
  - Context Isolation Failure
  - Data Leakage
- Analyze privacy risks arising from AI-assisted chat summarization
- Demonstrate how indirect prompts can cause unintended disclosures
- Suggest mitigation strategies for AI-driven applications

---

## 🧠 AI in Scope
- **Application:** WhatsApp
- **AI System:** Meta AI (Llama-based conversational assistant)
- **Capabilities Analyzed:**
  - Context-aware responses
  - Chat summarization
  - Memory-based inference

---

## 📸 Evidence & Screenshots
All screenshots included in this repository:
- Are anonymized and masked
- Do not contain real personal identifiers
- Are captured for **educational demonstration only**

Screenshots illustrate:
- Prompt injection behavior
- Partial disclosure of relationship context
- AI mitigation through randomization
- Conversation summarization anomalies

---

## 🔬 Methodology (High Level)
1. Threat modeling of AI conversation memory
2. Identification of prompt injection points
3. Indirect payload crafting using semantic hints
4. Observation of AI responses
5. Validation of partial data leakage
6. Analysis of built-in mitigation behavior

Detailed methodology is available in `methodology.md`.
